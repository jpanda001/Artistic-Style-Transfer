# Artistic Style Transfer
The objective of this project is to design a deep learning model that manipulates photographic
images to adopt the visual style and colouring patterns of artistic images while preserving the
original shape and geometry of the photographic images. Figure 1 below shows an example
of this image manipulation process which is referred to as artistic style transfer.

Figure 1: ​ Visualization of a style transfer process. The transformed image preserves the shape and geometry of
the content image, but adopts the style and colouring pattern of the style images. ​ (In this document, all
photographic images are called content images while all artistic images are called style images.)
